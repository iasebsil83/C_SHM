This program is a simple utility library that will allow you to manipulate shared memory (shm)
on linux a little bit easier than sys/shm.h does.

Demonstration programs are made in prog1.c & prog2.c (please launch Prog1 first).

More information about this library are available in shm.c.

DISCLAIMER : This program is not a substitute of sys/shm.h but a complement.
             sys/shm.h gives a lot of options on shm management, shm.h is a way much simpler.
